    "## The First Two Years:\n", 
    "  - From the outset of the American Revolution, the war was funded through a balance of private and public loans. The largest loans came from France and Spain and paying them back gives us the entire premise of what's to follow in this document. Congress also began printing Continentals; which quickly lost value as they were not backed by any physical asset. As this currency rapidly depreciated in value, there needed to be new avenues of funding and paying back national debt. Here they are!\n",
    "## Funding Between 1776-1780s\n",
    "- **Loan Office Certificates:**\n",
    "  - Totals: Between December 1776 and December 1781, there were 80,913 loan office certificates issued to 17,264 individuals and firms.\n",
    "  - Developed following Congressional vote to borrow $5M Continental dollars [October 3, 1776].\n",
    "  - Typical principal values were between 200 and 10,000 in Continental dollars. Each State had a unique loan office commissioner responsible for keeping track of accounts and paying coupons. Principal payments were due in 1787.\n",
    "  - The initial coupon rate of 4% in 1776 was not appealing to private investors. In January/February 1777, Congress provided $15M in new loans and raised interest rate to 6%.\n",
    "  - Prior to March 1, 1778, coupon payments made in bills of exchange could be redeemed in France (Spanish dollars). Since certificates were bought with Continental dollars, the rapidly decreasing value of the Continental dollar pushed rates of return from 7% to 30%.\n",
    "  - Certificates issued between March 1778 and May 1781 were paid in Continental dollars. Meaning they were a fraction of the original return. Coupon payments ceased in 1780 because Congress suspended payment in paper money.\n",
    "  - Continental government issued 4x the bills of credit than issued loan office certificates.\n",
    "  - **Definition: Bill of Credit** - a note issued by the government on its own credit with an implication to circulate as money. Represents indebtedness to the holder.\n",
    "  - Loan Office Certificates were used to purchase goods and supplies through the Quartermaster and Commissary departments.\n",
    "- **Buyers of Loan Office Certificates:**\n",
    "  - Of the 17,264 recorded individuals/firms with holdings, most were small investors with total purchases directly from the loan under $100 in specie.\n",
    "  - Many well-known founding fathers purchased loan office certificates, namely Adams, Franklin, Washington, Schuyler, and Arnold.\n",
    "  - Top purchasers of these certificates were primarily men responsible for supplying the Army. That is, these loans were used to fund supplies directly.\n",
    "  - Example: John Jacob Faish, 1780, was contracted to produce shells and cannons. After completion, the Continental Congress authorized a warrant issue from the loan office on April 17, 1780. On the same day, the Pennsylvania Loan Office issued Faish 816 certificates with a face value of 464,500 dollars. Throughout the war, there were 839 certificates and $483,400 in value. Unfortunately, Faish was never fully repaid with the 'present Situation of the Treasury' cited as lack of ability to further pay.\n",
    "- **Revisions of Loan Office Certificates:**\n",
    "  - June 28, 1780: Congress made changes to promises on certificates. Certificates issued on/prior to September 1, 1777 were unaffected. Those sold after September 1, 1777 lowered the number of Spanish dollars promised in principal and coupon based on a depreciation schedule. That is, down to 'specie value'.\n",
    "- **Marketability of Loan Office Certificates:**\n",
    "  - Increasing interest on loan certificates created more demand for the certificates.\n",
    "  - Why were these certificates seemingly more appealing to smaller scale investors? Since these certificates were heavily used to supply the army, these were quick contractual notes issued to those who were building ammunition, wielding, etc.\n",
    "- **Commentary on Loan Office Certificates:** An attempt to provide a relatively stable flow of funding for the early years of the War. Further, in order for suppliers to be paid back, these were a necessity to develop. However, due to the lack of funds in the Treasury, many of these certificates were never paid back in full.\n",
    "- **Liquidated Debt Certificates:**\n",
    "- Similar to Bills of Credit, Congress authorized officials to issue certificates of indebtednes to civilians for war supplies. These were substitutes for money and adaptable.\n",
    "- Issued by Quartermaster and Commissary departments. \n",
    "- After depreciation of Continental dollar in 1778 and 1779, certificates became the primary payment for supplies. Meaning, they became a crucial part of funding the war as struggles with paying back loans continued.\n",
    "- *Difference*: Compared to loan office certificates, debt certificates were based heavily in civilian hands. Office certificates were held in commercial areas by merchants and smaller investors in the war. Office Certificates were marketed towards investors involved in direct war support while debt certificates were meant to consolidate debts for war-related supply contracts.\n",
    "- Ultimately, the loan office certificates proved had a major lack of stability in terms of funding and the Continental government had extreme difficulty in paying back loans. Debt certificates provided a more stable repayment with a goal to alleviate concerns of rapid depreciation of Continental currency.\n",
    "- The final difference lies in issuance authority with office certificates maintained under Continental oversight while debt certificates were issued directly by Continental Congress.\n",
    "- On March 13, 1781, Robert Morris was appointed Superintendent of Finance; arguing that the Continental government needed a stable revenue. The debt, he stated was linked to a need for national taxes.\n",
    "- Morris failed on a national tax, but was successful in consolidating debts owed to civilians.\n",
    "- **Morris Process:** In 1782, Morris chose a commissioner for each state verifying, revaluing, and settling claims of individual citizens. Converted claim into equivalent specie value. Individuals received their liquidated debt certificate in exchange for the old certificate.\n",
    "- New certificates promised to pay 6% Interest annually, and Continental loan officers were responsible for interest payments.\n",
    "- Currently no records for quantity of certificates of indebtedness issued, most were likely absorbed by the States. Absorbed means the states most likely assumed ownership of the certificates and could have treated them as part of financial obligations for the states.\n",
    "- **Debt Certificates by John Pierce:** lalallalal dooodododood.\n",
    "- **Other Credits:** intelligent things.\n"
